  - name: distance
    description: 'Distance from the coordinate to the closest border of the geofence.
      Positive

      means the coordinate is outside of the geofence. If the coordinate is outside
      of the geofence,

      but more than the value of searchBuffer away from the closest geofence border,
      then the value

      is 999. Negative means the coordinate is inside of the geofence. If the coordinate
      is inside

      the polygon, but more than the value of searchBuffer away from the closest geofencing

      border,then the value is -999. A value of 999 means that there is great confidence
      the

      coordinate is well outside the geofence. A value of -999 means that there is
      great confidence

      the coordinate is well within the geofence.'
